# Settings 

[mod-setting-name]
bzsilicon-recipe-bypass=Bypass recipes
bzsilicon-more-intermediates=Enable more intermediate recipes such as silicon wafers.
bzsilicon-bio-crushed-stone=When using Bio Industries, use crushed stone to make silica.

[mod-setting-description]
bzsilicon-recipe-bypass=Skip modifying these recipes (comma-separated list).
bzsilicon-more-intermediates=More complex production chains. Optional in vanilla, Space Age, etc. [color=red]Required for Bio Industries.[/color]
bzsilicon-bio-crushed-stone=This setting is experimental, and may be removed in a future update. It's strongly recommended to keep it enabled. Only disable if your UPS is dropping due to inserter count. Added per user request.
